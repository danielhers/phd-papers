\begin{abstract}
  Syntax can benefit semantic parsing,
  as shown by methods such as multi-task learning and syntactic features.
  However, these methods are almost invariably generic,
  and are not informed by the details of target schemes and constructions.
  A comparative study of syntactic and semantic treebanks can enable
  the development of more informed methods.
  In this paper we compare and contrast syntactic and semantic schemes,
  taking Universal Dependencies (UD) and UCCA as a test case.
  %We emprically evaluate in what cases the two schemes converge and diverge in their content,
  After abstracting away from differences of convention or formalism,
  we find that most content divergences can ascribed to: 
  (1) UCCA's distinction between a Scene and a non-Scene; % as opposed to UD's POS-based distinctions;
  (2) UCCA's distinction between participants and secondary relations; %, not accounted for by UD; 
  (3) different treatment of multi-word expressions (e.g., light verbs), and
  (4) different treatment of inter-clause linkage.
  We further discuss two major constructions, where the schemes take markedly different approaches:
  adjectival clauses and open clausal complements.
  To demonstrate the feasibility of informed protocols for using syntax in semantic parsing,
  we show that a simple converter can be used to improve UCCA parsing performance.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

  A central goal of syntactic parsing is to provide a proxy for semantic structure.
  Indeed, syntactic parses have been leveraged by semantic parsing technology in a variety of ways,
  including pruning the space of possible semantic structures \cite{xue2004calibrating}, 
  encoding syntactic structure as features in semantic parsing \cite{gildea2002automatic}, 
  joint syntactic and semantic parsing \cite{surdeanu2008conll,hajivc2009conll} and
  multi-task learning \cite{swayamdipta2018syntactic}. 
  Some syntactic representation approaches, such as CCG \cite{Steedman:00} and Universal Dependencies \cite[UD; ][]{nivre2016universal},
  transparently reflect the underlying semantics, and have been used to
  transduce skeletal semantic forms using rule-based systems \cite{Basile:12,white2016universal,reddy2017universal}.
  
  Nevertheless, despite the close link between syntactic and semantic representations,
  and despite their centrality, few works attempted to map what content overlap and differences
  are there between syntactic and semantic structures.
	Understanding such content differences will support better ways to leverage content overlap
	between schemes, as well as point at semantic distinctions that are unlikely to be resolved by syntax.
	A methodology for comparing syntactic and semantic treebanks can also support fine-grained error analysis 
	of semantic parsers, as implemented by \citet{szubert2018structured} for AMR parsing.
	
	This paper aims to address this gap, taking the syntactic Universal Dependencies scheme,
  and the semantic Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation \cite[UCCA; ][]{abend2013universal} scheme
  as a test case. 
  The paper focuses on {\it content} differences, i.e., differences that cannot be resolved by simple
  conversion rules. Selecting two relatively similar schemes, such as UD and UCCA, allows
  us to focus on content, and abstract away from differences of convention.
  
  For instance, UD strongly prefers lexical heads,
	unlike other dependency schemes that prefer functional ones.
  While the two approaches are largely inter-translatable
	\cite{Schwartz:12}, lexical head schemes are more similar in form to semantic schemes,
	such as UCCA and broad-coverage semantic dependencies \cite{oepen2015semeval},
	which facilitates their comparison.\oa{is this paragraph clear?}
	%Selecting more distant schemes for comparison could have potentially confounded our results.
		
	
%	Comparing relatively similar schemes therefore 
%	allows us to focus on principle differences between them, and abstract away from 
%	divergences that can be resolved straightforwardly.
		
  %Moreover, in order to attain cross-linguistic applicability, UD's design conventions are 
  %often not dissimilar to those made by semantic schemes. A notable example is UD's preference
  %of forming dependencies between lexical heads, rather than functional ones.
  %Moreover, UD structures have been recently transduced into skeletal semantic 
  %structures \cite[e.g.,][]{reddy2016,predpatt}, underscoring UD's conceptual similarity to semantic treebanks.
  %Since the purpose of the paper is to compare {\it content} differences, i.e., differences in the information
  %encoded by the structures, rather than their form, taking UD already cleans out much structural divergence
  %originating from differences of convention.
  
	We find that most content differences between the schemes are due to the following factors:\oa{daniel, we need
	to add references here to the appropriate places in the text}

  \setlength{\leftmargini}{15pt}

  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item 
      UCCA distinguishes between Scenes (descriptions of events, states or activities) and non-Scenes. 
      This distinction cuts across UD categories, as a Scene can be evoked by a verb, an eventive or stative
      noun (``negotiation'', ``fatigue''), an adjective or even a preposition (``this  is {\bf for} John'').
    \item
      UCCA distinguishes between participants (including locations and abstract entities), and secondary verbs, 
			which covers for example manner, aspect and modality. Secondary relations can verbs (e.g., ``begin'', ``fail''),
			prepositional phrases (``with disrespect''), as well as modals, adjectives and adverbs. 
    \item
			UD and UCCA treat multi-word expressions (MWEs) differently. MWEs in UD include names, compounds and grammaticalized fixed 
			expressions. UCCA also treats names and grammaticalized MWEs are units, but also treats 
			a range of semantically opaque constructions as units (e.g., light verbs and idioms).
			On the other hand, compounds are not necessarily treated as MWEs in UCCA, especially where they are compositional.			
		\item
			UD categorizes clause linkage into coordination, subordination, argumenthood (complementation),
			and parataxis (a residual category). UCCA only distinguishes between argumenthood 
			and largely conflates clausal coordination, subordination and parataxis. 
			Other divergences stem from ...\oa{fill in}. 
	  \end{enumerate}\daniel{add interesting example---scene-evoking noun or auxiliary verb}

	UCCA uses DAGs so as to allow encoding shared argumenthood, by assigning multiple parents to the same node. 
	As UD uses trees rather DAGs, shared argumenthood is largely ignored in UD, but is addressed in enhanced UD \cite{}.

\section{Split between the Sections}\daniel{remove this section and move anything worthwhile to intro}

  The motivation for parsing into semantic structural representation is that it can be used more readily
  by semantic applications to reason about the processed utterance and manipulate it to find the required
  result.
  For example, in machine translation, a common model is the Vauquois Pyramid 
  \cite{vauquois1968survey},
  according to which translation between languages will become easier and more direct as we use
  a more semantic representation for the source and target languages,
  ignoring language-specific distinctions and capturing only what is preserved in translation.
  Parsing the source language and generating the target language, on the other hand, becomes more
  difficult as the representation becomes more semantic.

  Semantic representation schemes have seen major progress in recent years \cite{abend2017state}.
  At the same time, semantic considerations are taken into account in the design of syntactic annotation schemes
  \cite{przepiorkowski2018arguments}.


  \begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluation metric,
    \item Amount of training data,
    \item Maturity of technology dedicated to the scheme,
    \item Learnability of the scheme.
  \end{itemize}


  Learnability, in turn, is affected by

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Formal annotation choices \cite{Schwartz:12},
    \item Actual content that the scheme attempts to capture.
  \end{itemize}


\paragraph{Content.}

Different schemes capture different content.
For example, dependencies are ambiguous as to the arguments of conjoined verbs:
``the store buys and sells cameras'' and ``she was reading or watching a movie''
are analyzed similarly, even though in the first sentence ``cameras'' is an argument
of both ``buys'' and ``sells'', and in the second sentence ``movie'' is only an argument
of ``watching''.
The UCCA representation does make this distinction, as Figure~\ref{fig:conjoined_verbs} shows.

    \end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Coordinated predicates in UCCA.
\label{fig:conjoined_verbs}}
\end{figure}

We begin by carefully examining the structures captured by each of the annotation schemes,
to find distinctions made by one but not the other.
To explore the difference in content, we experiment with converting UD to UCCA
using a two-step protocol:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Structurally convert bilexical dependency graphs into constituency-like graphs by inserting
  non-terminal nodes and \textit{head} edges (\S\ref{sec:conversion}).
\item Translate UD relations into UCCA edge labels
  by a deterministic mapping (\S\ref{sec:mapping}).
%  or through learning (\S\ref{sec:learning}).
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Evaluation.}

Apart from the set of distinctions each scheme makes,
an important driver of the difference in scores is the proportion of each constructions
in the evaluation.
This implicitly determines what the scheme focuses on and what parser developers
will spend a larger effort improving.

For example, punctuation takes up 11.4\% of the edges in the English EWT UD treebank,
and parsers typically achieve more than 90\% LAS F1 on punctuation.
In UCCA, punctuation is excluded from the evaluation completely.

A multi-word named entity is represented in UD by a \verb|flat| arc between
each pair of consecutive words in the entity mention.
In UCCA, a named entity is represented as one unanalyzable unit, and analyzing it
incorrectly results in an incorrect edge with no partial credit.

\section{Representations}\label{sec:representations}

  Both schemes are designed to be applicable across languages and domains, 
  to support rapid annotation and to be suitable for downstream language understanding applications.\oa{start by saying something about their conceputal similarity}



\paragraph{Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation.}\label{sec:ucca}
UCCA \cite{abend2013universal} is a semantic representation whose main design principles
are ease of annotation, cross-linguistic applicability, and a modular architecture.
UCCA represents the semantics of linguistic utterances
as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where terminal (childless) nodes
correspond to the text tokens, and non-terminal nodes to semantic units that participate
in some super-ordinate relation.
Edges are labeled, indicating the role of a child in the relation the parent represents.
Nodes and edges belong to one of several \textit{layers}, each corresponding
to a ``module'' of semantic distinctions.
UCCA's \textit{foundational layer} (the only layer for which annotated data exists)
mostly covers predicate-argument structure, semantic heads and inter-Scene relations.

UCCA distinguishes \textit{primary} edges, corresponding 
to explicit relations, from \textit{remote} edges (appear dashed in
Figure~\ref{fig:example_ucca}) that allow for a unit to participate
in several super-ordinate relations.
Primary edges form a tree in each layer, whereas remote edges enable reentrancy, forming a DAG.

    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Universal Dependencies.}\label{sec:ud}
UD \cite{nivre2016universal} has quickly become
the dominant dependency scheme for
syntactic  annotation in many languages,
aiming for cross-linguistically consistent and coarse-grained treebank
annotation. Formally, UD uses bilexical trees, with edge labels 
representing syntactic relations between words.
Figure~\ref{fig:original_example_ud} shows an example UD tree.

UD includes \textit{enhanced dependencies}\footnote{\url{http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/enhanced-syntax.html}}
as part of the dependency graph, representing
case information, elided predicates,
and shared arguments due to conjunction, control, raising and relative clauses.
They provide richer information to downstream semantic applications,
making UD better suited for text understanding.

\section{Shared Gold Standard Corpus}\label{sec:data_size}

Syntactic dependency parsers require many training examples to achieve
state-of-the-art results.
Even after around 500K tokens, the learning curves do not seem to saturate
\cite{de2017old,velldal2017joint}.

Whereas the largest UCCA training set (English Wiki) contains 128K tokens,
The largest joined English UD training set (EWT) contains 177K tokens.
In French UCCA has just 10K training tokens whereas UD has 295K,
and in German UCCA has 80K and UD 228K.

Table~\ref{tab:partial_data_results} shows results for TUPA,
trained on 10\%, 20\% etc. of the Wiki training set and tested on the Wiki development set.
As can be seen, the primary labeled F1 continues improving substantially even from 90\% to 100\%
of the training data. More training data is likely to yield even better performance.

\section{Comparison Methodology}\label{sec:conversion}

\subsection{Structural Conversion}\label{sec:structural}

We convert UD trees and graphs into a unified DAG format \cite{hershcovich2018multitask,hershcovich2018universal}.
The format consists of a rooted DAG, where the tokens are the terminal
nodes.\footnote{Our conversion code supports full conversion between UCCA and UD,
among other representation schemes,
and is publicly available at \url{http://github.com/danielhers/semstr/tree/master/semstr/conversion}.}
As in the UCCA format, edges are labeled (but not nodes),
and are divided into \textit{primary} and \textit{remote} edges,
where the primary edges form a tree (all nodes have at most one primary parent,
and the root has none).
Remote edges enable reentrancy, and thus together with primary edges
form a DAG.
Figure~\ref{fig:converted_example_ud} shows an example for a converted graph.

\footnote{Enhanced UD structures \cite{schuster} use DAGs to encode
		shared argumenthood, using a more restricted notion thereof than UCCA's. Future work
		will explore the differences and commondalities between enhanced UD edges and remote UCCA edges.}

To convert UD into the unified DAG format,
we add a pre-terminal for each token,
and attach the pre-terminals according to the original dependency edges:
traversing the tree from the root down, for each head token we create a non-terminal
parent with the edge label {\it head},
and add the node's dependents as children of the created non-terminal node
(see Figure~\ref{fig:converted_example_ud}).
Any \textit{enhanced}
heads beyond the normal head of a node are converted to remote edges in the unified DAG format.
In the conversion process, we strip any language-specific relation subtypes,
leaving only the universal relations.
For example, the language-specific \verb|acl:relcl| is replaced by the universal relation \verb|acl|.



\subsection{Label Mapping}\label{sec:mapping}

Using the standard UCCA evaluation
script,\footnote{\url{http://github.com/danielhers/ucca/blob/master/scripts/evaluate_standard.py}}
we create a confusion matrix between the edge tags in converted UD graphs
and the annotated UCCA graphs (see Table~\ref{tab:confusion_matrix}).
We performed this analysis on gold UD and UCCA graphs from the EWT corpus (see \S\ref{sec:experiments}).
Edges are matched by terminal yield.
In this confusion matrix, we can see what is the most common UCCA edge label corresponding
to each UD relation.
To convert the UD graphs into fully labeled UCCA graphs,
we replace each UD edge label with its most common UCCA counterpart.

The \textit{head} edges introduced as part of the conversion do not have a single
corresponding UCCA edge label---although C (center) is the most common corresponding label,
other labels such as P (process) are also common.
This is a difference between UD, which selects the most central token to be the head of a phrase,
to UCCA, which also annotates the relation between that head and the unit it is part of.
To overcome this limitation, we replace all \textit{head} labels with C, but then
apply standard UCCA
normalization\footnote{\url{https://github.com/danielhers/ucca/blob/master/scripts/normalize.py}}
to the resulting graphs after conversion,
replacing C with P when it has sibling A's (participants) or
with H when it has sibling H's (parallel scenes).
We select P rather than S (state) as the main relation in the normalization because
it is much more common (14,719 P's in the Wiki corpus as opposed to 3354 S's).

\subsection{Local Modifications}\label{sec:local}

In general, the conversion protocol attaches low,
selecting for each terminal $t$ the lowest non-terminal of which $t$
is the head terminal.
To abstract away from convention differences,
we extend the conversion protocol by adding special rules
promoting the dependents of \verb|cc| relations,
and of \verb|mark| dependents with an \verb|advcl| head
(e.g. ``when'', ``if'', ``after'', and purposive ``to''),
as there is a systematic mapping between the UCCA and UD guidelines

\section{Analysis of Divergences}\label{sec:analysis}


\subsection{Automatic identification of divergences}

In order to automatically detect divergences between UCCA and UD,
we compare the unlabeled yields of all nodes for each sentence.
We use manually annotated data for both schemes.
Excluding punctuation, this gives 13293 yields in UCCA and
9817 in UD in the EWT dataset (\S\ref{sec:experiments}).
Of these, 8416 are common, meaning that an oracle would get an $F_1$ score
of 72.8\% if it had the gold label for each edge on conversion.

The analysis excludes the relation root, punct and flat due to formalism differences

and the relations csubj, dep, goeswith and orphan since they are rare
($\leq 10$ samples)

In the following subsections, we categorize the UD relations according to their
treatment in UCCA.



\subsection{Largely Similar Treatment}\label{sec:similar}
These constructions are handled similarly in UD and UCCA,
perhaps with differences of convention or formalism (but almost no content differences):

\paragraph{det, expl, iobj, nsubj, and obj.}
With an almost perfect match to UCCA categories,
these relations are syntactic refinements of
Elaborator (det), Function (expl) and pArticipant (iobj, nsubj and obj).
The exceptions are mostly cases of unanalyzable multi-word expressions,
which are analyzed in UD: ``a bit'', ``bites the dust'', ``when it comes to''.
In addition, nsubj and obj are annotated as Process or State when they
represent a (nominal) predicate,
and the determiner (det) ``no'' as an aDverbial when it modifies one.
Some nsubj instances of ``it'' and ``that''
are analyzed as expletives in UCCA (and annotated as Function),
and some wh-pronouns (``which'', ``who'') as Linkers or Relators.

\paragraph{aux and cc.}
aux is split between Function (auxiliary verbs) and aDverbial (modals),
while cc is split between coNnector (between non-scenes) and Linker (between scenes).

\paragraph{cop.}
UCCA distinguishes between copular constructions expressing
identity (e.g., ``It was an ingrown toenail'') where the copula is annotated as State
(and the head is a pArticipant),
as opposed to attributes or set membership
(e.g., ``Mercedes and Dan are very thorough''), where it is annotated as Function
(and the head is a State).

\paragraph{mark.}
UCCA distinguishes between the infinitive marker ``to'', annotated as Function,
and the use of markers for inter-scene linkage (e.g., purposive ``to''), annotated as Linker.
\daniel{still struggling to find an R mark that shouldn't actually be an L}


\subsection{Refinement}

Different axes of generalization, but the divergence can be fairly straightforwardly defined.

\paragraph{advcl and parataxis.}
Apart for some convention differences regarding the attachment of subordinate clause markers,
both advcl and parataxis almost exactly correspond to H (Parallel Scene).
However, inter-scene linkage gets a flat structure in UCCA,
so any coordinates scenes nested inside parataxis in UD do not match any one scene.

\paragraph{advmod and obl.}
A/D distinction is different

\paragraph{amod.}
Split between E, S and E|S

\paragraph{compound.}
Not a semantic category. We should add a few examples in the paper, but this is not surprising

\paragraph{discourse.}
H/L/G distinction

\paragraph{fixed.}
Unanalyzability is different (I would add an example or two)

\paragraph{head.}
about 17\% are unmatched, about 14\% are not P/S/H/C, which
leaves about 70\% of cases where the notion of syntactic head matches
that of a ``UCCA head''.



\subsection{Complex Content Differences}

\paragraph{acl.}

Nominal predicates.

A noun annotated as a process.

26307003:
Did services I asked them NOT to do.

Free/fused relative clause.

26315003:
The prices were worth what I got.

Flattening of scene structure.

26510000
Did a great job of removing my tree in Conyers.

\paragraph{xcomp.}

\paragraph{conj and list.}
Distinction between Scene and non-Scene coordination (not very interesting).
While in conj the dependent \verb|cc| is attached to the following conjunct in UD,
in UCCA coordination is annotated as a flat structure.
This is convention difference that we fixed with local modifications (\S\ref{sec:local}).
Otherwise most conj would be unmatched.



\subsection{Cases that require a deeper look into}

\paragraph{appos.}
why so many unmatched? (it makes sense that it's split between E/C)

\paragraph{case.}
mostly match (because it's usually one word), but prepositions can be several things in UCCA (relators which are similar to case markers, but also main relations, the borderline between analyzable and unanalyzable plays some role).

\paragraph{ccomp.}
why so many unmatched?

\paragraph{nmod.}
In UCCA, this is split across A, E, E|S. 

\paragraph{nummod.}
why so many unmatched. We need some examples.

\paragraph{vocative.}
probably just split between A and G+A, but we need a manual inspection of all of them.



\subsection{Discussion by UCCA Labels}

Going over each category is somewhat redundant, but we do discuss unmatched UCCA units, according to category (and put the histogram of units).

\caption{Number of tokens and sentences in the training, development and test sets

\end{table*}

\paragraph{Data.}

For UCCA, we use v1.2.3 of the English Wikipedia corpus (\textit{Wiki}),
with the standard train/dev/test split (see Table~\ref{tab:corpora}),
and the \textit{Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea} corpora (\textit{20K}),
annotated in English (v1.2.2), French (v1.2.2)
and German (v1.0.1).\footnote{\url{http://github.com/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation}}

For comparability with previous work \cite{hershcovich2017a,hershcovich2018multitask},
we also perform our experiments on Wiki v1.2.0 \cite{abend2013universal},
on 20K v1.0.0 in English and French \cite{sulem2015conceptual},
and on 20K v0.9.0 in German.
As in previous work, we use English 20K only as an out-of-domain test set.

For UD, we use the \verb|English_EWT|, \verb|French_GSD| and \verb|German_GSD|
treebanks from Universal Dependencies v2.3
\cite{11234/1-2895}.\footnote{\url{http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-2895}}
These are the largest freely-available UD treebanks for these languages.

We also use 804 English sentences from the reviews section of the English Web Treebank
\cite[EWT; ][]{bies2012english},
annotated by two UCCA annotators and
cross-reviewed.\footnote{The data will be publicly
available upon publication.}
As these sentences are included in the Universal Dependencies \verb|English_EWT| treebank,
we have both gold-standard UCCA and UD for them.
We refer to this set as \textit{intersection} henceforth.

\paragraph{Conversion of gold UD annotations.}

We apply our conversion protocol (\S\ref{sec:conversion}) to
the gold-standard UD trees of the English EWT intersection sentences,
and evaluate on the gold-standard UCCA for the same sentences.
We then apply the label mapping to get fully labeled converted UCCA graphs.

\paragraph{Conversion of automatically parsed UD annotations.}

To evaluate the conversion on the UCCA corpora that do not have gold-standard UD,
we instead start from automatically parsed UD as the source.
To parse text into UD, we use UDPipe v1.2 \cite{udpipe,udpipe:2017},
trained on the UD v2.3 treebanks.

\paragraph{Baselines.}

As a point of comparison, we evaluate TUPA \cite{hershcovich2017a} on the test sets,
after training it on the UCCA training set for each language (Wiki for English,
and 20K for French and German).
For equal conditions,
we train and test TUPA using features predicted by UDPipe,
yielding slightly lower scores than previously reported using spaCy.%\footnote{\url{https://spacy.io}}

\paragraph{Using converted UD as ``silver-standard'' data.}

Using our conversion protocol (\S\ref{sec:conversion}),
we convert the gold-standard UD graphs into UCCA.
We use the converted UD data as ``silver-standard'' data \cite{W17-7306,N18-1104}
and add it to the UCCA training set for training TUPA.

\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:conversion_results_unlabeled} shows \textit{unlabeled} evaluation of the
converted UD graphs as compared to gold-annotated UCCA graphs (\S\ref{sec:conversion}).
Labeled evaluation results, after applying the label mapping,
appear in Table~\ref{tab:conversion_results_labeled}.

Despite the simple conversion protocol, the scores are quite high:
strikingly, conversion from UD performs better on primary edges than
TUPA, a parser trained specifically on UCCA parsing,
for the English EWT and French 20K sets.
TUPA underperforms on English EWT likely due to domain shift,
and on French 20K it is trained just on 15 sentences.

For comparison, the unlabeled evaluation (Table~\ref{tab:conversion_results_unlabeled})
serves as an oracle experiment for the labeled conversion,
and is an upper bound given a fixed structural conversion.

\newcite{wang2015transition,wang-xue-pradhan:2015:ACL-IJCNLP,wang-EtAl:2016:SemEval,goodman2016noise,wang2017getting}
presented a transition-based AMR parser, CAMR, which requires a
syntactic dependency tree as input.
It operates on the input tree, transforming it into an AMR graph
by a sequence of transitions.
The accuracy of the underlying syntactic dependency parser is important,
as shown by \newcite{wang-xue-pradhan:2015:ACL-IJCNLP},
who achieved the best results using the Charniak parser trained on a
much larger and more diverse dataset---the full OntoNotes corpus,
rather than the Stanford parser trained on the Penn TreeBank.

\newcite{szubert2018structured} showed that when comparing AMR to Universal Dependencies (UD),
97\% of AMR edges are evoked by words or syntactic relations.

\newcite{damonte-17,szubert2018structured} suggested fine-grained evaluation measures
for AMR parsing, using sub-tasks of the AMR parsing task or UD labels to evaluate on.
Similarly, our conversion protocol allows fine-grained evaluation of UCCA parsing.

\paragraph{Semantic role labeling.}

\newcite{swayamdipta2018syntactic} used multitask learning to improve semantic role labeling and coreference resolution
by also learning unlabeled syntactic bracketing as an auxiliary task.

Much effort has been devoted to joint learning of syntactic
and semantic parsing, including
two CoNLL shared tasks \cite{surdeanu2008conll,hajivc2009conll}.
%on joint syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling.
Despite their conceptual and practical appeal, such joint models rarely outperform
the pipeline approach %of basing semantic parsing on the output of syntactic parsers
\cite{lluis2008joint,henderson2013multilingual,D15-1169,swayamdipta-EtAl:2016:CoNLL,swayamdipta2017frame}.

\paragraph{UCCA parsing.}

\newcite{hershcovich2018multitask} improved UCCA parsing with multitask learning, sharing parameters
between UCCA and other semantic parsing tasks, as well as Universal Dependency Parsing.
We perform a similar experiment, but instead of a multitask model,
we use UD data converted to UCCA and train on it with the same single-task model (\S\ref{sec:experiments}).


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We carefully examine similarities and divergences between UD and UCCA,
and develop a converter whose accuracy is on par with a UCCA parser.
